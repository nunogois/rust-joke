# rust-joke

A simple command line joke app written in Rust using https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/

Based on my previous [go-joke](https://github.com/nunogois/go-joke) project.

There's a specific branch [reference](https://github.com/nunogois/rust-joke/tree/reference) that shows setting the joke variable as a reference.

Install the app by running: go install and then simply run joke on your terminal for a random joke!

You can also ask for a specific type of joke, e.g. joke programming

You can also build the app by running: go build

I'm still learning Go, so let me know if you catch something wrong!
